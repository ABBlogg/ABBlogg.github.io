# Me

I am an Australian living in Vancouver! I come from a small city called Albany on the south-west coast.
I have completed three out of four years of my degree at the University of Western Australia, double majoring
in Computer Science, and Mathematics and Statistics.
Besides math and coding, my interests include history, literature, and film.

# This website

I built (and host) this site using GitHub Pages and Jekyll. I decided against using Jekyll's prebuilt themes
in order to teach myself more about front-end development.
